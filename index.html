                            customer service, and her skills in image creation and creative solutions, she loves to step outside of her comfort
                            zone. With her foot fidgeting under the table, she is happy and ready to jump into any problem or project.

                            A long time ago, Albert bought a one-way ticket to New York City with a dream of working for the legendary

                            he escaped back to Canada to begin his photographic career. In Vancouver, Albert has established an
                            extensive list of clients and prestigious assignments. Meanwhile, he continues to experiment with light,
                            colour, and is ever easily distracted by shiny things.
